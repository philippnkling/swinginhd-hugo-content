# Images
If you want to use images in a post you need a specific structure as the template has specific requirements.

1. Create a folder with a name similar to the usual markdown files YYYY-MM-DD_<name>
2. Create or copy a markdown file and name it `index.md` and place it in the just created folder
3. Copy the image that you want to use in the folder (same level as the `index.md` file)
4. Add two lines to the `index.md` file
  a) in the header insert a line with `image: <filename>`, where `<filename>` is e.g. `social.jpg` if you put an image with this name in this folder.
  b) add a line in the bottom part of the file that credits the file `> Photo by ...`
  
The following photos can be found in this folder

|filename|Suggested credit|
